Hi,

A task killed while close() flushes its dirty pages gets its writes
refused by __smb_send_rqst() (fatal signal pending), and netfs then ends
writeback with the folios clean.  The data never reaches the server and
no error reaches the application: stat() still reports the cached size
while the file on the server is short.  It was reported against a RHEL 9
kernel, where the same trigger makes stat() fail with -EIO after a
rename(2), and it reproduces on mainline as this silent lost write.

Any other failure that is only transient hits the same wall: since the
move to netfslib, a failed upload ends writeback with the folios clean,
so a reconnect, a lost handle, an interrupted wait or an -ENOMEM
silently drops the data.

This series makes writeback retry instead of giving up:

 - writes of a dying task are issued from a new workqueue, and the waits
   on close() and fsync() are killable (patches 8-10, 12)
 - writeback is retried with exponential backoff, up to 2 seconds, on
   replayable errors, interrupts, -ENOMEM, and on losing the connection,
   the share or the handle (patches 6, 7, 11, 13, 14)
 - reopening a handle is retried the same way for all kinds of I/O,
   instead of looping forever on -EAGAIN (patch 14)
 - umount -f aborts the retries and the reconnect waits of requests that
   started before it (patches 5, 15)

On hard mounts writeback is retried until the server comes back or
umount -f.  On soft mounts it gives up after max(3, retrans) *
echo_interval from the first failure of each write, which is 3 minutes
by default.  Since cifs only declares a server dead after 3 echo
intervals, that is about 6 minutes from the outage.  The error recorded
then is -EIO.  Reads and direct writes still follow the hard and
retrans mount options.

Patch 1 is independent: writeback could pick a handle opened with
O_DIRECT, and Windows rejects unaligned writes on those with
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER.  The pages were dropped, 1.2% of the writes in
xfstests generic/051.  It is first so it can be backported on its own.

Patches 2-4 are netfs fixes the cifs patches depend on.  Patch 2 is
Ivan's, taken from his posting
(20261028181229.1408342-1-ivanrwcm25@gmail.com).  Patch 3 stops netfs
from retrying writes while subrequests are still being prepared, which
raced on stream->sreq_max_len.  Patch 4 keeps the ->prepare_read() errno
instead of -ENOMEM when read retries are abandoned.

Tested against a Windows server:

 - a reproducer for the problem above: a writer is killed with SIGKILL
   while close() flushes a large write, or a multithreaded program exits
   right after writing without closing the file.  The file is then
   renamed, stat()ed and checked on the server.  The data is lost
   without the series
 - xfstests generic/051: no rejected writes left after patch 1
 - umount -f with writeback in flight
 - a soft mount with the server down for shorter and longer than the
   retry window
 - reads with a handle that has to be reopened after a reconnect

Not covered by this series:

 - writeback started by the unmount itself after umount -f can still
   wait on a hard mount
 - tcons shared with other mounts and the per-user tcons of multiuser
   mounts are not covered by umount -f
 - credit waits and the shutdown ioctl don't stop on umount -f
 - if every writable handle of an inode was opened with O_DIRECT, its
   unaligned writeback still fails, and the error is reported
   (e.g. mmap of an O_DIRECT file descriptor)

Thanks,
Paulo
