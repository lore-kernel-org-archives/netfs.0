Hi,

A task killed while close() flushes its dirty pages gets its writes
refused by __smb_send_rqst() (fatal signal pending), and netfs then ends
writeback with the folios clean.  The data never reaches the server and
no error reaches the application: stat() still reports the cached size
while the file on the server is short.  It was reported against a RHEL 9
kernel, where the same trigger makes stat() fail with -EIO after a
rename(2), and it reproduces on mainline as this silent lost write.

Any other failure that is only transient hits the same wall: since the
move to netfslib, a failed upload ends writeback with the folios clean,
so a reconnect, a lost handle, an interrupted wait or an -ENOMEM
silently drops the data.

This series makes writeback retry instead of giving up:

 - a dying task's writeback is issued from a workqueue, and the close()
   and fsync() waits for it are killable
 - writeback is retried with exponential backoff on replayable errors,
   interrupts, -ENOMEM and on losing the connection, share or handle,
   and handle reopens are retried the same way
 - umount -f aborts the retries, reconnect waits and replay loops of the
   mount's requests, and writeback no longer blocks in the reconnect wait
   so the unmount's own sync can't hang there

On hard mounts writeback is retried until the server comes back or
umount -f.  On soft mounts it gives up after max(3, retrans) *
echo_interval from the first failure of each write (3 minutes, and about
6 minutes from the outage since that is when cifs declares the server
dead), recording -EIO.  Reads and direct writes still follow the hard
and retrans mount options.

Patch 1 is independent: writeback could pick a handle opened with
O_DIRECT, and Windows rejects unaligned writes on those with
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER, dropping 1.2% of the writes in xfstests
generic/051.  It is first so it can be backported on its own.

Patches 2 and 3 are netfs fixes the cifs patches depend on: patch 2 is
Ivan's (20261028181229.1408342-1-ivanrwcm25@gmail.com), keeping the
prepare_write() errno across a reissue; patch 3 does the same for
prepare_read() when read retries are abandoned.

Tested against a Windows server, all passing:

 - the reporter's case: a writer killed by SIGKILL mid-close(), and a
   multithreaded program exiting without close(), then rename()+stat()
   (loses data without the series)
 - xfstests generic/051 (no rejected writes left after patch 1)
 - umount -f with writeback in flight, on hard and multiuser mounts
 - a soft mount with the server down shorter and longer than the window
 - reads with a handle reopened after a reconnect

Not covered by this series:

 - the credit wait doesn't stop on umount -f, so a request blocked
   waiting for credits from a gone server can still hang the teardown
 - if every writable handle of an inode is O_DIRECT (e.g. mmap of an
   O_DIRECT fd), its unaligned writeback still fails, with the error
   reported

Thanks,
Paulo

Changes since v3:
 - new patch to stop a mount's tcons from reconnecting and replaying for
   the duration of the forced-unmount teardown, so a reconnect wait or a
   per-PDU replay loop (a close work item in particular) entered after the
   unmount began can't hang cifs_kill_sb(); it also covers tcons shared
   with another mount for those moments, and fails the reconnect worker
   fast so it can't pin and leak the tcon, session, server and cifsd thread

Changes since v2:
 - stop writeback started after a forced unmount (e.g. the unmount's own
   sync) from retrying forever on a hard mount
 - fail writeback sends and reopens fast at every point in
   smb2_reconnect(), not only the first, so a reconnect that starts
   midway can't still block the unmount
 - abort a write's first retry under umount -f even before netfs bumps
   its retry count
 - keep a dying task from looping in the reopen retry, and keep a read
   from looping on a forced -EAGAIN retry
 - track the bad handle (-EBADF) across out-of-order subrequest failures,
   and recheck the handle after the backoff sleep

Changes since v1:
 - new patch to not write back through O_DIRECT handles (data loss of its
   own, found by generic/051); put first for an independent backport
 - dropped the netfs patch that deferred write retries until all
   subrequests were queued (could deadlock writeback under memory
   pressure); keep the prepare_read() errno on abandoned read retries
   instead
 - issue writeback sends and handle reopens without waiting for a
   reconnect, and make umount -f also stop the credit wait, cover
   multiuser per-user tcons, and not be gated by tc_count, so the
   unmount's own sync can't hang
 - make the reopen retry reconnect-aware and bounded, don't replay
   reopens inside SMB2_open(), track the bad handle (-EBADF) per request,
   and fix a retried read failing with -EAGAIN and a dying-task writeback
   looping on a reopen that gave up
 - record -EIO (not a transient errno) when writeback finally gives up
