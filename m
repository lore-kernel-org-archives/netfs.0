Many standard libraries will call stat before / after opening a file to
allocate a buffer matching the file size. Or to figure out if mmap
is more efficient than opening it directly.

So Python's open().read() or Go's os.ReadFile they may throw an error
when opening the file, making it look as if the file is inaccessible
when its contents are. They make the assumption that if a file is
readable, the metadata is too.

There's also a lot of metadata that is already leaked by just having
READ_FILE. FS_IOC_GETFLAGS/FS_IOC_FSGETXATTR ioctl / fileattr_get are
unrestrictable and allow you to see inode attributes. There's also
access(2) which isn't restricted here and allows you to see your rights
on the file. The size can be found by simply seeking to the beginning
and end. So much of the metadata is obtainable with just READ_DIR/READ_FILE.

...

Another problem I'm just realizing is that this READ_METADATA
right is inconsistent with open file descriptor behavior. With most
rights, already open file descriptors are exempted, but here, fstat,
(and the other stat-family calls which takes a file descriptor) become
denied even on already open files. It's a catch 22 here, if you change
the fstat to not apply to opened files, then READ_FILE becomes a bypass
for READ_METADATA. But if you leave it as is, then it's inconsistent with
the other Landlock rights wrt already opened files.

Which isn't the end of the world, but just shows that either
approach is going to have it's quirks. 

I think it would be better to just avoid the cat and mouse game here
of trying to seperate READ_FILE/READ_METADATA and either require
READ_METADATA be specified with READ_FILE if READ_METADATA is handled
like Gunther proposed, or have READ_FILE imply READ_METADATA.

Documenting it strongly is OK too, but really there are really zero
usecases where you'd want to grant READ_FILE without READ_METADATA
so it would need to be made extremely clear.

Thanks,
Justin
